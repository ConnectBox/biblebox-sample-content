Welcome to the ConnectBox Demo Site: https://demo.connectbox.org

The ConnectBox is a media sharing device based on small form-factor computers
like the Raspberry Pi. This site demonstrates the current ConnectBox client
interface, as it would be seen if it were deployed on a Raspberry Pi using the
ConnectBox Sample Content. This site is automatically updated to show the most
recent revision of the client interface from https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi

The ConnectBox admin interface can be viewed at https://demo.connectbox.org/admin/
but none of the administrative actions are enabled.

The Connectbox project can be found at https://github.com/ConnectBox/
and the scripts and source code for creation of a Raspberry Pi ConnectBox
are at https://github.com/ConnectBox/connectbox-pi
